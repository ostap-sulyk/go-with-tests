# Learning Go with Tests

This repository is part of my journey to learn Go by following the **[Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)** guide.

## Overview

The repository contains small programs and their corresponding tests, built incrementally as I progress through the guide. Each program is designed to teach a specific Go concept or feature.

## Goals

- Learn Go following best practises.
- Build a strong foundation in writing clean and effective tests.
- Learn by doing, iterating, and improving.
